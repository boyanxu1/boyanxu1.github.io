<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a researcher at Guangdong University of Technology, working in the **DMIR Lab** under the supervision of [**Prof. Ruichu Cai**](https://ruichucai.github.io/). My research focuses on **Text-to-SQL**, **Large Language Models**, **Sentiment Analysis**, and **Machine Learning**. My work aims to bridge the gap between natural language processing and database management, enhancing human-computer interaction.

My research interests include:

- **Text-to-SQL:** Developing models that translate natural language queries into SQL statements, facilitating intuitive database interactions.
- **Large Language Models:** Exploring the capabilities and applications of large-scale language models in various NLP tasks.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing and interpreting human emotions and opinions through computational methods.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems across different domains.

I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals. You can find my publications and citation metrics on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AMUlDdEAAAAJ&hl=en).
