<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a researcher at Guangdong University of Technology, working in the [**Data Mining & Information Retrieval Laboratory**](https://dmir.gdut.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [**Prof. Ruichu Cai**](https://ruichucai.github.io/). My research focuses on **Text-to-SQL**, **Large Language Models** and **Sentiment Analysis**. My work aims to bridge the gap between natural language processing and database management, enhancing human-computer interaction.

My research interests include:

- **Text-to-SQL:** Developing models that translate natural language queries into SQL statements, facilitating intuitive database interactions.
- **Large Language Models:** Exploring the capabilities and applications of large-scale language models in various NLP tasks.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing and interpreting human emotions and opinions through computational methods.

I am always keen to collaborate with motivated students and industry partners on Text‚Äëto‚ÄëSQL agents, causal LLMs and ABSA. Drop me an email with your CV and a short statement of interest.

[Handling Missing Entities in Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition: Integrated Recall and Retrieval Augmentation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.540.pdf)

Ruichu Cai, Junhao Lu, Zhongjie Chen, **Boyan Xu‚Ä†**, Zhifeng Hao

-  We introduce IRRA, a novel two-stage framework that first uses recall-augmented entity extraction on perturbed data to boost recall and then applies retrieval-augmented generation for type correction, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot cross-domain NER performance.

[Track-SQL: Enhancing Generative Language Models with Dual-Extractive Modules for Schema and Context Tracking in Multi-turn Text-to-SQL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.536.pdf)

Bingfeng chen, Shaobin Shi, yongqi luo, **Boyan Xu‚Ä†**, Ruichu Cai, Zhifeng Hao

-  We propose Track-SQL, a dual-extractive framework that augments generative LMs with a semantic-enhanced schema extractor and a schema-aware context extractor to track schema and context changes in multi-turn Text-to-SQL, achieving state-of-the-art results on SparC and CoSQL with execution accuracy gains of 7.1% and 9.55%.
